To include the File System module, use the require() method:  var fs = require('fs'); Common use for the File System module:  Read files Create files Update files Delete files Rename files Read Files The fs.readFile() method is used to read files on your computer.  Assume we have the following HTML file (located in the same folder as Node.js):  demofile1.html  <html> <body> <h1>My Header</h1> <p>My paragraph.</p> </body> </html> Create a Node.js file that reads the HTML file, and return the content:  Example var http = require('http'); var fs = require('fs'); http.createServer(function (req, res) {   fs.readFile('demofile1.html', function(err, data) {     res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});     res.write(data);     res.end();   }); }).listen(8080); Save the code above in a file called "demo_readfile.js", and initiate the file:  Initiate demo_readfile.js:  C:\Users\Your Name>node demo_readfile.js If you have followed the same steps on your computer, you will see the same result as the example: http://localhost:8080  Create Files The File System module has methods for creating new files:  fs.appendFile() fs.open() fs.writeFile() The fs.appendFile() method appends specified content to a file. If the file does not exist, the file will be created:  Example Create a new file using the appendFile() method:  var fs = require('fs');  fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('Saved!'); }); The fs.open() method takes a "flag" as the second argument, if the flag is "w" for "writing", the specified file is opened for writing. If the file does not exist, an empty file is created:  Example Create a new, empty file using the open() method:  var fs = require('fs');  fs.open('mynewfile2.txt', 'w', function (err, file) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('Saved!'); }); The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content if it exists. If the file does not exist, a new file, containing the specified content, will be created:  Example Create a new file using the writeFile() method:  var fs = require('fs');  fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'Hello content!', function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('Saved!'); }); Update Files The File System module has methods for updating files:  fs.appendFile() fs.writeFile() The fs.appendFile() method appends the specified content at the end of the specified file:  Example Append "This is my text." to the end of the file "mynewfile1.txt":  var fs = require('fs');  fs.appendFile('mynewfile1.txt', ' This is my text.', function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('Updated!'); }); The fs.writeFile() method replaces the specified file and content:  Example Replace the content of the file "mynewfile3.txt":  var fs = require('fs');  fs.writeFile('mynewfile3.txt', 'This is my text', function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('Replaced!'); }); Delete Files To delete a file with the File System module,  use the fs.unlink() method.  The fs.unlink() method deletes the specified file:  Example Delete "mynewfile2.txt":  var fs = require('fs');  fs.unlink('mynewfile2.txt', function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('File deleted!'); }); Rename Files To rename a file with the File System module,  use the fs.rename() method.  The fs.rename() method renames the specified file:  Example Rename "mynewfile1.txt" to "myrenamedfile.txt":  var fs = require('fs');  fs.rename('mynewfile1.txt', 'myrenamedfile.txt', function (err) {   if (err) throw err;   console.log('File Renamed!'); }); Upload Files You can also use Node.js to upload files to your computer.

Likewise, a publishing platform is an environment where you can experience a chatbot. The popular chatbot publishing platforms are FB Messenger, Kik, Slack, Telegram, and WeChat.  A chatbot publishing platform is a medium through which the chatbot can be accessed and used by the users. It’s more like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc which provide a platform through which you can publish your thoughts which would be visible to your friends and everyone else.
